  # Want a global batch size of 2048 because SwinV2 was trained on 16 V100s with batch size 128 (I think)
  # But we are going to use a global batch size of 1024 because it's faster (throughput).

  # We are using limited epochs based on pre-training configs for imagenet22k
  # Then we will pre-train on 256x256 for 30 epochs
